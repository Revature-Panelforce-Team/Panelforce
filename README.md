Stephon - For some reason, my formatting does not work until I put my component on a lightning tab. I have no idea why but I have checked that the "implements" had the same value in it. If you do not do that, then it will only have the Owner ID field and my buttons. I believe it is the RecordEditForm causing this display behavior.
